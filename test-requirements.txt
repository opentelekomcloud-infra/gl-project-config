# The order of packages is significant, because pip processes them in the order

# We need to pin the ansible version directly here; per the
# deprecation policy it should trail the version used by Zuul by 4
# weeks to give people time to update before these roles start
# depending on new features.  Also note we can't just include zuul
# here to pull in ansible anyway; pip doesn't actually have a
# dependency solver and the uncapped ansible requirement from
# ansible-lint pull in the latest version.
ansible==2.9  # <-- keep it as old as possible
# We need to pin ansible-lint to before 4.0 which blows up all over the place
